## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Responsive or mobile friendly approach
- ReactJS
- Redux Toolkit - for state management
- MUI - for the styling
- Date-FNS - to get date difference
- Netlify - to host the challenge website

### What I learned

- I learned to use MUI from setting it up, setting the initial theme, using its the out of the box components and overriding them as I see fit.
- I learned to use Redux Toolkit persist middleware for local storage and use it to manage my state.
- Pace myself and do the challenge small step at time, since I admit the challenge was hard for me.

### Continued development

- Clean the code and refactor them.
- Maybe style the site better.
